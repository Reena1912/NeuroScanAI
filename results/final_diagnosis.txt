### Final Diagnosis:

After reviewing the medical reports from the Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist, our multidisciplinary team has identified the following 3 possible health issues of the patient:

* **Anxiety Disorder**: The patient's history of anxiety, family history of generalized anxiety disorder, and current symptoms of chest pain, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath are indicative of an anxiety disorder, possibly Panic Disorder. (Reason: Consistent findings across Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist reports)
* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The patient's GERD may be causing chest pain and shortness of breath, which may be exacerbated by their high-stress job and irregular exercise habits. (Reason: Mentioned as a possible cause of symptoms in Cardiologist and Pulmonologist reports)
* **Undiagnosed Cardiac Condition**: Despite the normal ECG, blood tests, and echocardiogram, there may be a subtle cardiac issue that is not yet apparent, such as a cardiomyopathy or coronary artery anomaly. (Reason: Cardiologist report highlights the possibility of an undiagnosed cardiac condition, and further testing is recommended to rule out any underlying coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy)
