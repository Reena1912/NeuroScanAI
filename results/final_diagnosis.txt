### Final Diagnosis:

After reviewing the medical reports from the Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist, our multidisciplinary team has identified the following 3 possible health issues of the patient:

• **Anxiety Disorder**: The patient's history of anxiety, family history of generalized anxiety disorder, and current symptoms of chest pain, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath are indicative of an anxiety disorder, possibly Panic Disorder. The Cardiologist and Psychologist reports both suggest anxiety as a potential contributor to the patient's symptoms.

• **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The patient's GERD may be causing chest pain and shortness of breath, which are exacerbated by the patient's high-stress job and irregular exercise habits. The Cardiologist and Pulmonologist reports both mention GERD as a potential contributor to the patient's symptoms.

• **Undiagnosed Cardiac Condition**: Despite the normal ECG, blood tests, and echocardiogram, there may be a subtle cardiac issue that is not yet apparent, such as a cardiomyopathy or coronary artery anomaly. The Cardiologist report suggests that further evaluation is needed to rule out any underlying cardiac conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.
